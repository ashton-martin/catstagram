# Catstagram
A full-stack of a web-based application.

##First, Answer This Question
*Start here young padouan and riddle us this question:*
* Do you use Instagram, Twitch, or Soundcloud, or any other web application? Do you *actually* know how they work? **PAUSE.**
* If the answer was *"No,"* that's okay. Even though over a billion people use these applications, 99.9%
of them don't either. **We want you to be in that .01%** of 
people that can explain to your friends and family exactly how every web-based project works, front to back. 

##How?
*How are you going to learn how web applications work?*
* You are going to learn by **building your own version of Instagram**, except only with
pictures of...cats.

##Why?
*Why you should want to know how web-based applications work:*
* You are alive in 2021, right!? The internet has already changed the way you live, learn, work, think, and play, right?! 
* Whether you choose to pursue a career building world-changing software or you become a musician, knowing how applications
work will open up an entirely new world to you, while also making you a more engaged, thoughtful member of society. 


##A Universal Diagram

##File Structure / File Tree
INTERNAL TODO: Insert picture of file structure from gitpod
* This project, like most projects, has its own folder, that contains the following:
    * **index.html page:**
        * This is the page that the browser loads and is the file that you should preview when you want to see an application
    * **brains.js**:
        * This is the javascript file, the brains of the operation.
    * **favicon.ico**
        * This is the icon that appears on the tab in the browser. It stands for "favorite icon"
        
 
## Part I: Preview index.html + Check for errors
*Below you will find instructions on what TODO to build Catstagram. Take each bulletpoint one by one. Work in Google Chrome*


####Todo #1: Investigate/Preview Index.html file
* Open the index.html file in Gitpod and look it over
* Ask the questions:
    * Do I know what each of these lines of html do?
    * What should I expect to see when I preview this file? *Hint: What's inside the body tag?*
    * Do I see any errors, any opening tags or closing tags that are wrong?
* Right click on the file index.html and click "Preview with LiveServer"
* Ask the question: 
    * Was I right? Am I seeing what I expected to see?
* Fix the errors in the html

####Todo # 2: Open the Console
* Right click the page and select "Inspect"
* Choose the tab labeled "Console"

INTERNAL TODO: Add file names markdown language look like

####TODO #3: Find/Fix the Errors
* Read the error, find what line the error is on, click on the link to the brain.js file
* Go back to Gitpod, remove the error so that the javascript file is empty.
* Save your work in Gitpod by click "Ctrl S" or File > Save
* Return to Chrome and refresh the page. Recheck the console for errors. You should see a no more error on line 1 of brain.js.


####What is Github and how do you use it?

####Guiding Questions
* What is the file tree?
* What does it mean to "inspect the page"? How do you get to the console of a page?
